# Th1nAI
An copilot written in HTML,CSS,JS with response database.

# What is it?
An HTML-based AI-based copilot with it's own question database. Currently we have limited database, but we will largen it. 

# What model it used
It uses Th1nner 5 (Octopus), an handmade AI model based on it. I wrote this model, along with this copilot.

# Does it have an API?
I plan to make a API for Th1nner 5 (Octopus) model.

# Where is Bing Maps and Search API?
Search API of Google implemented, but it's not working. Due to Maps API we don't need it, I removed it. Due to issues I encountered during development, I removed it cuz it's going to be an rework for the new model "Bubblefire!" that is planned to be released at  June 20, 2025.

# Can I decompile and modify it?
No! You can't decompile it. I put more work on it for Ranvir and how smilar to my other HTML projects, this should be do as well, And that is, use the original files that make your copy of this program.

# Status Update about beta software
Now backers will get a beta version of this software before 1 week of it releases, so donate at least $10 at patreon.com/th1nn or ko-fi.com/ranvir and wait for the next pre-release betas. An free registration will also available if I plan it.
